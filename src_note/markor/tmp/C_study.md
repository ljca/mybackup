To follow the example of The Definitive C++ Book Guide and List for C Books here is a wiki post for organization.

A tag search for "C" and "Books" returns no complete book list results as of writing this question. That search is here.

This post is to providing QUALITY books and an approximate skill level. Maybe we can add a short blurb/description about each book that you have personally read / benefited from. Feel free to debate quality, headings, etc.

Not to belittle the question, which is good, but...most people take years to master K&R. There is more in there than you think. The thinness of the book is deceptive. – dmckee Jul 14 '09 at 21:32

Above Intermediate: Robert Sedgewick, "Algorithms in C". Top notch. – Jens Apr 13 '11 at 20:13

If you are new to C, keep in mind that modern C is ANSI C and anything predating that standard (1989) may be wildly out of date. Shoot for the mid-90s or later. – Dana Robinson Jun 7 '11 at 1:28

@Dhaivat I think not, be careful to jump on the K&R bandwagon. K&R does not address good program design nor good programming practice, mainly because it was originally written before anyone knew what good programming practice was. It does not mention which parts of the C language that are superfluous or even dangerous. The book is correctly listed as a reference manual, it should not be used for teaching/learning modern programming. – Lundin Aug 12 '11 at 7:45

Harbison & Steele is definitely the best reference I have ever seen. I sincerely hope Sam (or someone else) will update the book for C1X. But: Even if it's a reference, I'd consider it unfit for beginners. In my experience, even intermediate programmers have trouble getting the details. It's great if you need to write a compiler for C, as the authors had to do when they started. – Johan Bezem Nov 9 '11 at 4:58
